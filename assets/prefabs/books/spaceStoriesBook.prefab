      "<f engine:NotoSans-Regular-Title>Exoplanets, Near and Far-</f><l>It’s been another good year for exoplanets, as the Kepler mission entered its extended mission with 105 confirmed planets under its belt. A different group of researchers, working with data from a telescope in Chile, found a planet orbiting our closest stellar neighbor – Alpha Centauri. The planet speeds around its star at a distance of just 6 million kilometers; for comparison, mercury only gets as close as 46 million kilometers to our Sun.",
      "<f engine:NotoSans-Regular-Title>A Long, Long Voyage-</f><l>The Voyager spacecraft are our most well traveled probes, high-tailing it toward the outer edge of our Solar System since 1977. The mission celebrated 35 years of operations this year, and marked the occasion by discovering a new region of the solar system. Previous estimates placed Voyager 1 outside the Sun’s reach, but instead, it’s reached “a magnetic highway where the magnetic field of the Sun is connected to the outside,” according to Project Scientist. Because the magnetic field lines haven’t changed direction, the team still believes Voyager is officially still in the Solar System, but it likely won’t be for long.",
      "<f engine:NotoSans-Regular-Title>The Holy GRAIL of Lunar Gravity Mapping-</f><l>The GRAIL mission comprised twin spacecraft – with two of the best names in recent memory, Ebb and Flow – tasked with mapping the Moon’s gravitational field and internal structure. The orbiters acquired data for nearly 12 months, producing beautiful detailed maps of surface and subsurface features. In the Bouguer gravity anomaly map above, contributions from surface features like mountains and valleys are removed; results indicate variations in crustal thickness or rock density. Based on this latest mine of data, the GRAIL team has shown that a very thin veneer of crust underlies some of the largest impact basins like Crisium and Moscoviense.",
      "<f engine:NotoSans-Regular-Title>An Iota of Hope-</f><l>Iota Lateralus, a binary star planetary system has several surrounding planetary systems that could possibly support life. Distant 3000+ light years away, Rosseta Parabole, shines with hope in a dark sky..."
